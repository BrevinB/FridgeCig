        <p class="effective">Effective date: February 10, 2026</p>

        <p>FridgeCig ("we," "our," or "the app") is operated by Brevin B. This Privacy Policy explains what data FridgeCig collects, how it is used, and your choices regarding that data.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Account Data</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display name and username you choose during setup</li>
            <li>An auto-generated friend code used to connect with other users</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Drink Log Data</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drink type, brand, timestamp, volume, notes, and ratings you record</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Photos</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optional drink photos you attach to log entries</li>
            <li>Photos are stored locally on your device and, if you choose, shared to the social activity feed</li>
            <li>All image processing (label recognition via Apple Vision) happens entirely on your device — no images are sent to any cloud service for analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Health Data</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you opt in, FridgeCig writes dietary caffeine data to Apple HealthKit</li>
            <li>This is strictly opt-in; no health data is read or collected without your explicit permission</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Contacts</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you grant permission, FridgeCig accesses first and last names from your Contacts to suggest friends</li>
            <li>Contact data is used only on-device for matching and is never uploaded to or stored on any server</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Device &amp; Account Info</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your iCloud account is used for data sync and social features</li>
            <li>We do not perform device fingerprinting or collect device identifiers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>Your data is used to provide FridgeCig's features:</p>

            <li>Personal drink tracking, streaks, and statistics</li>
            <li>Badge and milestone calculations</li>
            <li>Leaderboards and social activity feed (shared with your friends)</li>
            <li>Weekly recap summaries</li>
            <li>Caffeine logging to HealthKit (if enabled)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple CloudKit</strong> — Syncs your data across your devices and powers social features (leaderboards, activity feed). Data is stored in Apple's iCloud infrastructure under their privacy policy.</li>

            <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Manages subscription status. RevenueCat receives only the purchase information necessary to validate your subscription; no personal data beyond what Apple provides for the transaction is shared.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> — Handles all payment processing. Apple manages billing, receipts, and payment information directly; we never see your payment details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. What We Do Not Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not use analytics SDKs or tracking frameworks</li>
            <li>We do not display ads or use ad networks</li>
            <li>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing</li>
            <li>We do not perform any cloud-based machine learning on your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Social &amp; Public Data</h2>
        <p>When you use FridgeCig's social features, certain data is shared with your friends:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaderboard stats (drink counts, streaks)</li>
            <li>Activity feed items (drink logs, badges earned, milestones)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You control what is shared. Badges, milestones, drink logs, and photos are each independently toggleable in your sharing preferences. You can also set your profile visibility.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud data is stored in Apple CloudKit and protected by Apple's iCloud encryption</li>

            <li>All image processing happens on-device using Apple's Vision framework</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Remove locally stored photos</li>
            <li>Remove your data from leaderboards and activity feeds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Caffeine data previously written to HealthKit must be removed separately through the Apple Health app.</p>
