## TikTok & Instagram Reels (Short-Form Video)

### 1. "POV" Videos

**Concept:** POV-style skits that Diet Coke lovers instantly relate to.

| # | Video Idea | Caption |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | POV: You open the fridge and there's only one Diet Coke left | "This is a national emergency. Also I'm logging this one. (link in bio)" |
| 2 | POV: Someone says "just drink water" | *stares in Diet Coke* "There's an app for people like us now." |
| 3 | POV: Your friend asks why you're taking a photo of your Diet Coke | "I'm logging it. I have a streak to protect." |
| 4 | POV: You realize you've had 6 Diet Cokes and it's only 2pm | "Not a problem, it's a lifestyle. FridgeCig tells me I'm on a 47-day streak." |
| 5 | POV: The McDonald's Diet Coke hits different and you need to document it | "McDonald's DC is its own category. Yes, there's an app that understands this." |

**What to film:** Face-to-camera reactions, fridge reveals, sipping moments. Use trending audio.

---

### 2. App Demo / Screen Recording Videos

**Concept:** Quick, punchy screen recordings showing off features. Record on-device, overlay with voiceover or text.

| # | Video Idea | Caption |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Speed-run logging a drink in under 3 seconds | "Logging a DC faster than drinking one. The app Diet Coke people didn't know they needed." |
| 2 | Scrolling through your badge collection | "I have 37 badges for drinking Diet Coke. My therapist has questions." |
| 3 | Show your weekly recap card being generated | "My weekly recap told me I drank 42 Diet Cokes. I call that a slow week." |
| 4 | Demonstrate the share card editor - pick theme, add stickers, export | "Making my DC stats look aesthetic before posting them. As one does." |
| 5 | Show the leaderboard - you're #1 among friends | "I'm finally #1 at something and it's Diet Coke consumption. I'll take it." |
| 6 | Unlock a rare badge in real-time | "Just unlocked 'Send Help' badge. Just kidding, send more Diet Coke." |
| 7 | Show the streak counter hitting a milestone (30, 100 days) | "100-day streak of logging Diet Coke every single day. This is commitment." |
| 8 | Apple Watch quick-log demo | "Logging a DC from my wrist because pulling out my phone was too much effort." |

**How to film:** Use iOS screen recording. Add text overlays in CapCut or the TikTok editor. Keep it under 30 seconds. Fast cuts.

---

### 3. "Day in the Life" / Lifestyle Content

**Concept:** Follow a Diet Coke lover through their day, logging every drink.

| # | Video Idea | Caption |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Morning routine but it starts with a Diet Coke, not coffee | "6am. First DC of the day. Logged. Streak: alive." |
| 2 | "Every Diet Coke I drank today" - show each one being logged | "A visual essay in 5 acts. All logged in FridgeCig." |
| 3 | Road trip but you stop at every gas station for a fountain DC | "Road trip essentials: Gas, snacks, and 4 fountain Diet Cokes. All tracked." |
| 4 | Grocery haul but it's just cases of Diet Coke | "My cart: 3 cases of Diet Coke. My app: ready." |

---

### 4. Trend-Jacking / Audio Trends

**Concept:** Use trending TikTok sounds with DC-related scenarios.

- **"I'm just a girl" audio:** Showing your FridgeCig stats (47 DCs this week)
- **"It's giving obsessed" audio:** Scrolling through badges
- **"Tell me you're ____ without telling me" audio:** Show the app home screen
- **"Very demure, very mindful" style:** "Very demure, very mindful... logging my 8th Diet Coke of the day"
- **Any "red flag" trend:** "He doesn't have FridgeCig" shown as the red flag

**Tip:** Check TikTok trending sounds weekly and adapt one to a DC angle.

### 5. Comparison / Duet / Stitch Content

| # | Video Idea | Caption |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Stitch someone asking "what's your most used app" - show FridgeCig | "Not the answer you expected but the answer you needed." |
| 2 | Duet a "show me your screen time" video - FridgeCig is top 3 | "FridgeCig beating Instagram in screen time is peak personality." |
| 3 | Reply to "what's an app you can't live without" comments | "It tracks my Diet Coke consumption. With badges. And a leaderboard." |

---

## Instagram Feed Posts (Static / Carousel)

### 1. Shareable Infographic Carousels

| # | Post Idea | Caption |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | "5 Types of Diet Coke Drinkers" carousel (The Purist, The Flavor Explorer, The Streak Obsessed, The Late Night Sipper, The Double Fister) | "Which one are you? Track your type with FridgeCig." |
| 2 | "Your Diet Coke Order Says About You" - McDonald's vs. can vs. fountain vs. bottle | "We don't judge. We just track. Link in bio." |
| 3 | "FridgeCig Badge Tier List" - show badge rarity from Common to Legendary | "How many have you unlocked? Start collecting." |
| 4 | "A Week in Diet Coke" - mock weekly recap card with fun stats | "This could be your weekly recap. Download FridgeCig." |
| 5 | "Diet Coke Bingo" card - things every DC lover relates to | "Screenshot, play along, and download FridgeCig to actually track it." |

**Design notes:** Use the app's brand colors (Diet Coke red/silver). Clean, bold typography. Make each slide standalone-shareable.

---

### 2. User-Generated Content Reposts

- Repost stories/posts from users sharing their FridgeCig stats, badges, or share cards
- Add "Featured Sipper" highlight on Instagram Stories
- Create a branded hashtag **#FridgeCig** (already in the app's share cards)

3. **Social competition** - "See how you stack up against friends."
4. **It's niche and proud** - "The app Diet Coke people didn't know they needed."
5. **It's beautiful** - Show the UI; let the design sell itself.
6. **Indie/authentic** - "Built by a DC lover, for DC lovers."
